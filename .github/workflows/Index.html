        <p>Amethyst is an Android client for the NOSTR social protocol, the decentralized, censorship resistant, cryptographically secure alternative to social media (and some other stuff), where you are in control of your social graph and content. Amethyst is feature rich, allowing you to partake in a wide array of activities with your friends, family &amp; communities online.  To download &amp; install, visit <a href="https://nostree.me/npub1gcxzte5zlkncx26j68ez60fzkvtkm9e0vrwdcvsjakxf9muqewqlfnj5z/amethyst">amethyst.social</a> for available options.  If you are unfamiliar with nostr, visit <a href="https://nostr.how/en/what-is-nostr">nostr.how</a> and <a href="https://www.whynostr.com/" target="new">whynostr.com</a> to learn more.</p>

        <p align="center">TAKE A MOMENT TO EXPORT YOUR PRIVATE KEY (nsec)TO A SAFE PLACE. IT IS LIKE A PERMANENT PASSWORD THAT YOU CAN USE ACROSS ALL NOSTR APPS AND IT CANNOT BE CHANGED. Logging out without saving it will leave you unable to access your profile. Amethyst offers in-app nsec encryption to more safely store your private key on devices. This is highly recommended. Writing it down works, too. Maybe do both.</p>

          <p> *Avatar and Banner URL: Unlike traditional socials, there is no central entity to store your media. You can choose any photo or video you have hosted anywhere online and enter the URL here. It can be from other socials, your own webpage, home server,or even a livestream.</p>
          <p> *NOSTR Address:  This is a way to claim ownership of your profile through some an external source, such as a webpage you own.  There are entities that will host this for you as well. It is not necessary, overall. Other nostr applications may require this to use their services.</p>
          <p>*LN Address:  NOSTR supports Bitcoin Lighting payments through zaps for tipping and service payment.  We will talk about zaps more later on in this guide.  If this is all foreign language to you, just skip for now.  Study Bitcoin and come back to this when you’re ready.</p>
          <p>*Twitter/Mastadon/GithubGist w/proof: This is another method of verifying ownership of your profile via other social sites. </p>

          <p>Tap your back button to return to your main feed (yes, its still blank)...</p>
          <p>Top center is your feed menu. You will have 3 options by default &amp; you can add more by following hashtags, creating lists, and joining communities. If you discovered nostr through another person, you can search them by username or npub with the search icon.</p>
          <p> *Hashtags:  Hashtags are a simple and effective way to find and share content on nostr.  Search a hashtag by typing it in your search box. click on the purple tag for notes and the option to follow the tag. Once followed, this will create a custom feed in your feed menu. The same appliesfor any subsequent tags. To unfollow any hashtag, visit your profile and find the followed tags tab in the ribbon. #grownostr and #plebchain will yield a variety of results.</p>
          <p>*Follows:Start finding people that may post notes that match your interests. Click on the profile photo of anyone you see and it will bring you to their profile. You can look through their follow lists too and find even more.</p>
          <p> Following lists are very unstable, due to the way nostr decentralization works.  You can look through but results will vary. </p>
          <p>*Lists:  Amethyst supports lists curated through other nostr apps, like <a href="https://listr.lol/">listr.lol</a> where you can create your own lists &amp; subscribe to those made by others. They will then show up in your Amethyst feed menu.</p>
          <p>*Global is a feed of random notes pulled from relays that you are connected to.  Interesting people and content can be found here, but also literally anything, so this is a good place to flex your freedom muscle and populate your 3rd list... MUTE.</p>
          <p> If you see something offensive, long press the blank space of that note. You will be presented a grid menu. The terms, mute and block, are used synonymous within Amethyst... so hit Block and congratulations, you’ve taken the first steps in controlling your own experience! </p>
          <p>This grid menu also gives you the option to follow/unfollow,  copy text/author ID/note ID, copy a link to share, broadcast to relays, or report illegal content to relay operators.</p>
          <p>*Conversation Tab: On Global, this is an easy way to discover people. It can help you find interesting discussions among your follows as well.          </p>

One offers more privacy protection. You can send messages this way by clicking the incognito icon.The recipient must be set up to receive these. Amethyst will initiate more secure DMs automatically, if proper relay configurations are detected.</p>

          <p>*Discovery Feeds</p>
          <p>A variety of feeds are available through DVMs, aka data vending machines. These feeds are created through AI assisted search run by various nostr users and builders. Some are free, others require payment. All of them offer a wide variety of content for you to explore.</p>
          <p>*Marketplace</p>
          <p> Amethyst offers basic marketplace support.  You can list your items for sale, browse, and message sellers.  To purchase via listing or manage your own listings, you will need to visit  <a href="https://shopstr.store/">shopstr.store</a> or any other marketplace client.</p>
          <p>*Live Streams</p>
          <p> Watch, zap, and participate in chat for live streams here. If you’re looking for new streamers, switch your feed menu to global. Stream your own content on <a href="https://zap.stream/">zap.stream</a> .</p>
          <p>*Communities</p>
          <p> A growing part of nostr is Communities, a more topic based Reddit-like experience.  Amethyst allows you to join and partake in Community discussions.    If you are wanting to start a Community, you’ll need to visit another client, such as <a href="https://satellite.earth/">satellite.earth </a>. Joining a community will add it to your main feed menu. Post to Communities by switching that feed prior to composing your note.</p>
          <p>*Group Chats            </p>
          <p>Access &amp; participate in group chats.  To start one, you’ll need to visit your message tab.        </p>

          <p>*Replies:  Its pretty self explanatory. Click the talk bubble at the bottom of any note to join the conversation.</p>
          <p>*Boost: also known as bump, share, retweet, or repost... it does just what you’d expect.</p>
          <p>*Quote: If you have something to add while sharing with your followers, this is the spot. </p>
          <p>*Fork: You can collaborate with peers on notes, and make sure that the proper credit and tips are given where deserved.  Maybe you have something to add? Maybe you’re writing a story togther? Give it a whirl.</p>
          <p>*“Likes” express a lot but they can express so much more.  Amethyst is set with preprogrammed reactions, tap and you’ll be presented with your default options. You can program your own, too, by long pressing the reaction button or touching the smiley+ icon, and simply adding the emojis.  You can add as many as you can fit on your screen. Remove the ones you don’t want with the white ‘x’ next to each. Be sure to click save and your good to go!</p>
          <p>Protip: Amethyst also supports custom emoji packs from nostr apps like <a href="https://emojito.meme">emojito.meme</a> where you can make your own, too.</p>
          <p>We’ve referred to Zaps repeatedly in this guide, and if you’re unfamiliar, it probably sounds like a foreign language.  Zaps are Bitcoin, demoninated in sats sent over the nostr network for tipping and payment.  You can send and recieve them.  You’ll need a BTC Lightning wallet that supports Lightning Addresses. With that, and different regulations in different countries, its a bit more than we can get into with this guide, but feel free to ask questions to other  users.  Bitcoiners love to help other people learn about bitcoin, so type out your questions and maybe add a #bitcoin or #asknostr tag.  You’ll learn quickly that there’s a lot to learn, but you’ll get the answers you need to get started with zaps pretty quickly. :) </p>
          <p>When you’re ready, Amethyst offers seamless Nostr Wallet Connect functionality that you can access by long pressing the lightning bolt on any note.  Once you have your wallet attached, you’re ready to zap.  Add your lightning address to your bio, in the field ‘lightning address” and you’re ready to receive.  Amethyst gives you the option to pre-program convenient zap amounts with the same long press, then save.  You can also attach a one-time message &amp; access zap privacy choices by double-tapping the lightning bolt on any note, giving you the ability to remain anonymous, keep it private, or send sats without any nostr event taking place. Reminder: these are a one-use setting, and messages attached to an anonymous zap are publicly seen.</p>
          <p>*Share a link with your uncool non-nostr friends via njump</p>
          <p>*The down arrow will display a random, or possibly thorough, view of who and how this note has been reacted to and zapped by. These &quot;little parties&quot; are a fun and simple way to discover other users and the emojis they use.        </p>

          <p>If you’re new to nostr, you shouldn’t have to worry too much about understanding relays until you get a little comfortable.  Amethyst is set with default relays to get you going, right out of the box, and it will guide you through adding what you need. Here is some basic information on various relays, Amethyst's settings, and how they can enhance your nostr experience:</p>
          <p>PUBLIC OUTBOX/HOME: These are the relays you wish to publish to for others to find your notes. You can write to free, public access relays. Paid, WoT(web of trust), and other specialty relays can be used here, too, each with their own benefits. Some will help to ensure your notes are not lost among spam. Others will limit who sees your content, based on topics, location, character count, or many other criteria. There are relay services to archive your content and those that will remove it after a predetermined time. The options are endless.</p>
          <p>PUBLIC INBOX RELAYS: These relays are generally the same as free, public relays. They will act as your basket for collecting reactions, zap notifications, replies, and any other interaction other users may send you. Paid relays can be used here, but for best results, make sure they support the <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips?tab=readme-ov-file#event-kinds" target="new">event types</a> you wish to see.</p>
          <p>DM INBOX RELAYS: These relays may specialize in sending and receiving metadata obfuscated messages. Others will support basic DMs with no added privacy. Most public relays support this. If you want to receive both types of messages, set a public relay, as well as a private DM specific relay.</p>
          <p>PRIVATE HOME RELAYS: These relays will store your personal and encrypted information, like your drafts &amp; settings. Its recommended that this be a relay that you control. You can run one from home server, on your device, or pay for a relay hosting service.</p>
          <p>SEARCH RELAYS: These relays excel at searching for people, notes, and text. Most are free to use but essential for looking up other users. </p>
          <p>LOCAL RELAYS: This type will run on your device. There is currently one application for android. Find it on <a href="https://zap.store/download/" target="new">zap.store</a> .</p>
          <p>GENERAL RELAYS: These are the relays that amethyst will look at to find notes from your follows. Check with your friends, see what they use and add as you see fit. There will also be some suggestions listed below this section. Settings here are actively usable. Up is write, down is read. You can turn those on and off, as well as whether these relays will send/provide data and content to your Global feed, your messages, and your contact lists. </p>
          <p>Be sure to click ‘save’ after any adjustments you make.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In complete UI mode,  you’ll notice little icons under the pfp next to a note.  These are the relays where a note was found.  Clicking on them will bring you to the relay card, providing you with information like who runs that relay and what types of nostr events they support.  Consider visiting a relay operator’s page and tipping some sats.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>To find new relays, visit a relay explorer like <a href="https://nostr.watch/relays/find">nostr.watch</a> or <a href="https://nostrrr.com/" target="new">nostrrr.com</a> . Check out some paid relay services at <a href="https://nostr.wine/" target="new">nostr.wine</a>  , <a href="https://relay.tools/" target="new">relay.tools</a> , and <a href="https://nostr.land/" target="new">nostr.land</a> .</p>
